Breakdown

1. Fetching and Processing Data:
The code fetches historical stock data for the specified stock symbol 
using the yfinance library. The data consists of daily closing prices 
for the last 5 years. The fetched data is then stored in the _ml_data 
variable.

2. Data Preparation:
The closing prices from the fetched data are extracted and stored 
in the closing_prices variable. The training data is created by 
excluding the last day's closing price, resulting in a dataset representing 
the last 30 days of historical closing prices.

3. Feature and Target Creation:
Features (x_train) are created as a 1D array representing the days 
from 1 to the length of the training data. The corresponding closing 
prices are used as the target values (y_train).

4. Random Forest Regression Model Initialization and Training:
A RandomForestRegressor model is initialized with 100 trees and a random 
seed of 1. The model is trained using the training data (x_train and y_train) 
to learn the patterns in the historical closing prices.

5. Prediction for the Next Day:
A feature for the next day (x_test) is created, and the trained model 
predicts the stock price for the next day. The predicted price 
is stored in the predicted_price variable.

6. Visualization and Plotting:
Matplotlib is used to create a plot with the last 30 days of training 
data displayed in blue. The predicted price for the next day is shown 
as a red point. The plot includes labels for the x-axis and y-axis, a 
title, and a legend indicating the training data and the predicted price.

7. Canvas Creation for Tkinter:
The plot is embedded into a Tkinter canvas (FigureCanvasTkAgg) to be 
integrated into a graphical user interface application. The canvas is 
placed at specific coordinates within the Tkinter window.

8. Return Value:
The canvas object containing the plot is returned, allowing it to be 
displayed within a Tkinter application.
