Breakdown 

1. Setting Time Frame: The time frame for the stock 
data is adjusted to 1 year.

2. Fetching Data: The code fetches historical stock 
data, specifically the closing prices, using the
fetch_data_range method.

3. Preparing Training Data: The training data is
prepared by taking the closing prices of the 
past 220 days.

4. Preparing Test Data: The test data is set as 
the next 30 days' closing prices.

5. Reshaping Data: The training data is reshaped into
2D arrays (x_train and y_train) as required by scikit-learn's
LinearRegression model.

Example:
[
    [1]
    [2]
    [3]
    [4]
]

6. Training the Model: The linear regression model is 
initialized and trained using the training data.

7. Making Predictions: The model predicts the closing 
prices for the next 30 days using the test data (x_test). 
The predicted prices are flattened into a 1D array.

8. Visualization: The actual closing prices and the 
predicted closing prices are plotted on a graph. A 
vertical line separates the actual and predicted prices.

9. Displaying the Graph: The graph is displayed using 
the tkinter library for graphical user interface 
applications.
